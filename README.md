## Overall Project Description

On Average, a person has at least 7 different accounts he or she has signed into, be it email, social media, entertainment or job portal accounts. It becomes really hard to remember all those passwords and even create new ones.
With ShieldPassword-Locker (see below user stories);  

### User stories
* As a user, you can create a password locker account with your details, a login username and password.
* As a user, you can store your already existing account credentials in the application. Assuming you already have a twitter account, you can store your already existing twitter username and password in the application.
* As a user, you can create new account credentials in the application. For example, if you have not yet signed up for Instagram, you would want to create a credentials account for Instagram in the application and the application generates a password for you to use when you sign up for Instagram.
* As a user, you can have the option of putting in a password that you can use for the new credential account. For example, when creating your Instagram credential account, you can have an option of putting in the password you can use instead of having the application generate a password for you.
* As a user, you also want to view your various account credentials and their passwords in the application.
* As a user, you can delete a credentials account that you no longer need in the application.
